I see you've stumbled upon my GitHub page! Hi, I’m @chibiininja

I’m interested in learning new programming languages and technologies! 
- My main programming knowledge lies in Java, C, and C++.
- I’m currently learning some front-end languages and frameworks, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js.

Some of my hobbies are:
- Listen to music
- Singing and learning new instruments
- Playing a variety of games (lots of roguelikes and indies)
